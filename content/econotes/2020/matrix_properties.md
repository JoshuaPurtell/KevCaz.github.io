I have been recently reading about matrix properties and I though I would share some notes about some readings. First, why  it as a good fresh up of property, in ecology when using the kind of stability where ecological and ecolutionary operates matrix and Borelli paper[^n1]<sup>,</sup>[^n2]. Why such properties are interested. Well at some point the property of the d

$$\mathbf{\dot{X}} = \mathbf{AX} \tag{1}$$

cool very cool $\sum_{i = 1}^n d_i$

\( \beta \)

I do not understand

x+\text{some $y+\text{some $z$}$} so no $\sum d$ and it is ok

During I read a couple of math paper to get property worte, I was happy to even tough I do not always folwo th edemonstateions. Anyway, in what follows just a couple of vlaueable definiton and

So below are a couple of definition that could be interested to have in minde√©

- **Definite positive matrix** [<i class="fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness_of_a_matrix)

- **Lyapunov stable**

- **prinicipal submatrix**

- **principal minors**

- **Diagonally dominant matrix**

- **D-stable**

- **P-matrix**

- **M-matrix**

- **Z-matrix**



And some interesting properties:

- principal submatrix of a
- Diagonally dominant matrix are invertible
