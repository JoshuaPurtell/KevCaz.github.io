I have been looking and it as a good fresh up of property, in ecology when using the kind of stability where ecologiacla and ecolutionary operates matrix and Borelli paper[^n1]


During I read a couple of math paper to get property worte, I was happy to even tough I do not always folwo th edemonstateions. Anyway, in what follows just a couple of vlaueable definiton and

Definite positive

Lyapunov stable

prinicipal submatrix

principal minors

Diagonally dominant matrix

D-stable

positive definite

P-matrix

M-matrix

Z-matrix



And some interesting rpopoer:

- principal submatrix of a
- Diagonally dominant matrix are ivertible
