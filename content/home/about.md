# About me


I am a post-doctoral fellow at [McCann Lab](https://www.mccannlab.org) with
a wide range of interests in ecology, from theoretical network ecology to very
applied restoration ecology. I regard myself as a theoretician/data
scientist motivated by a strong desire to apply the results of abstract
investigations to tangible challenges such as the impact of land-use change on
ecological networks.

During my PhD, I investigated the relationship between biotic interactions and
species co-occurrence. Species's range limits are indeed not only affected by
abiotic factors (such as precipitations and temperature), but they also are
determined by the biological context. Although this was first suggested years
ago, researchers are still struggling to find adequate approaches that appropriately
include all of these factors which are key towards accurate predictions of
tomorrow's biodiversity. I have found some promising research avenues to elucidate the
conditions under which biotic factors cannot be neglected to predict species'
distribution. If by any chance, this interests you, you may want have a look at
my [PhD dissertation](/pdf/thesekc.pdf).


In the post-doctoral project I have started in June of 2017, I am striving to apply the results of my PhD on the fish communities of the Ontario's lakes. I am also developing an integrated theory of biogeography including energy transfer, ecological networks and dispersal. Furthermore, there are a couple of projects
in which I am involved and I hope to be able to tell you about very
soon!

Last thing I should mention about me is that I am a code-enthusiast (currently
spending most of my coding-time on R and C/C++, but I enjoy coding in many
programming langages, see my CV) and a graphics-lover (I should probably say
data-visualisation-lover as it sounds fancier nowadays).
