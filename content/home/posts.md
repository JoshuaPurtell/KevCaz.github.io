## inSileco

Since early 2017, I have started writing a blog with a couple of colleagues/friends
with whom I share similar interests: ecology (at large), open-science, open-data,
coding. If you think you may be interested in such topics, you better check out
our blog hosted on the [inSileco website](https://insileco.github.io/docs/)!
