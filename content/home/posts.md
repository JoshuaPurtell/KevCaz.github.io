Since early 2017, I have started writing a blog with a couple of colleagues/friends
with whom I share similar interests: ecology (at large), open-science, open-data,
coding. If you think you may be interested in such topic you better check the blog hosted on the [LetiR website](https://letir.github.io/docs/) out!
