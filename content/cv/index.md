I am a currently post-doctoral fellow at [the McCann
Lab](http://www.mccannlab.ca) with a wide range of interests in ecology. I
regard myself as a theoretician motivated by a strong desire to apply the
results of abstract investigations to tangible challenges such as the impact of
global change on ecological communities.  

For over six years now, I have been tackling research challenges in various
areas of ecology. I have mainly been focusing on theory in macro-ecology and
network ecology but I have also been working on various topics such as
epidemics, forest dynamics, homogenization of fish communities, analysis of
media coverage, meta-ecosystems and food security. I have been facing a wide
spectrum of technical problems and have acquired a very broad set of
quantitative skills including wavelets analysis, biodiversity analysis, network
analysis, Bayesian statistics, etc.
