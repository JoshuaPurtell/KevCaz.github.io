I am a currently a post-doctoral fellow at [the McCann
Lab](http://www.mccannlab.ca). I am currently doing quantitative ecology for a
leaving. As such, I do my best to apply the results of abstract investigations
to tangible challenges such as the impact of global change on ecological
communities.

For over six years now, I have been tackling research challenges in various
areas of ecology. I have mainly been focusing on theory in macro-ecology and
network ecology but I have also been working on various topics such as
epidemics, forest dynamics, homogenization of fish communities, analysis of
media coverage, meta-ecosystems and food security. I have been facing a wide
spectrum of technical problems and have acquired a very broad set of
quantitative skills including wavelets analysis, biodiversity analysis, network
analysis, Bayesian statistics, etc.
