## In a nutshell

I'm **Kevin Cazelles** and for over six years now, I have been tackling research
challenges in various areas of ecology. I have mainly been focusing on theory in
macro-ecology and network ecology but I have also been working on various topics
such as epidemics, forest dynamics, homogenization of fish communities, analysis
of media coverage, meta-ecosystems and food security. I have been facing a wide
spectrum of technical problems and have acquired a very broad set of
quantitative skills including wavelets analysis, biodiversity analysis, network
analysis, Bayesian statistics, etc.
