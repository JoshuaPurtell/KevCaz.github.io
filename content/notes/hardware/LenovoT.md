When I switch from MacOS to Debian, I had no idea what computer to buy
so I look on the Intenet, as expected it was hard to find reliabke source
of information among sites that actually to some ad for a given and obviously
even poolry reliable coputer are found quite often... I end up behing
a [Lenovo ThinkPad T470p](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470p-Core-i7-GeForce-940MX-Laptop-Review.226802.0.html).

I am now on Debian and follows several mailing list and sounds like Debian
people usually appreciate Lenovo as a brand and mroe particurlarly
ThinkPad. I retain a couple of advice from the mails people
exchange: if you can afford it consider buying professioanle lne of product
easy to fix your self, avoid component car-mere soud√©e, also it is trendy
to have a thiune compter allow so but funny enough as Iread in one email.
the batteries supplier does not change and so far if you f travelling the
weight represent a sinificant amont of the computer weight :imp:.
