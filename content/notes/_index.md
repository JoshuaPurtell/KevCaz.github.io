In my professional life, I mainly write about ecology (see the [publications](../publications)
section) but I spend a fair amount of my time on my computer looking at new
freeware, new computational tools, new langages, etc. to find the best practice
and share with other. That is the reason why I partner up with colleagues/friends
to start [inSileco](https://insileco.github.io/), a blog that focuses on
computational tools for ecologists. As I wrote in one of the posts hosted on t
his blog, I am currently [working on Debian testing](https://insileco.github.io/2018/06/18/my-r-setup-on-debian/) :smile:,
and I often learn how to with my computer. This is a section where I report
notes on various topic that I find useful
