In my professional life, I mainly write about ecology (see the [publications section](../publications)) but I spend a fair amount of my time on my computer looking at new freeware, new computational tools, new programming langages, etc. in order to find better practices and share them with colleagues. That is the reason why I partner up with colleagues/friends to start [inSileco](https://insileco.github.io/), a blog that focuses on computational tools for ecologists. I try to post on this blog regularly medium-size articles and I decided
to report short note in this section (I may compile some of them for a blog
on [inSileco](https://insileco.github.io/)). As I wrote in one of the posts hosted on this blog, I am currently [working on Debian testing](https://insileco.github.io/2018/06/18/my-r-setup-on-debian/) and notes
I gather here may often be reltaed to Debian!
