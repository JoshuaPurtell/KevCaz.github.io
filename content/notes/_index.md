title: Notes

In my professional life, I mainly write about ecology (see the [[publications]] section) but I spend a fair amount of my time on my computer looking at new freeware, new computational tools, new langages, etc. to find the best practice and share with other. That is the reason why I partner up with colleagues/friends to start [inSileco](https://insileco.github.io/),
a blog that focuses on computational tools for ecologists. As I wrote in one of the posts hosted on this blog, I am currently [working on Debian testing]().
