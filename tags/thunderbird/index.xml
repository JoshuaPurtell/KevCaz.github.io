While I was and still am happy with Firefox 60, when I tried Thunderbird I had some issues&amp;hellip; Basically, I was not able to send a message and one of my favorite add-on, Markdown-Here, was not available for this version ðŸ˜¢. So, I needed to get the previous version back. I searched for an answer and found this one, very helpful!</description></item></channel></rss>
