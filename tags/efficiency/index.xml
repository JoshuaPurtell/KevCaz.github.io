      <title>A bug in the command wrapper of r-core-base 3.5.1-1&#43;b2</title>

      <description>Today, as I working on a post, I got this issue when using the R command wrapper:
$ Rscript --no-site-file -e &#39;blogdown::serve_site()&#39; /usr/lib/R/bin/R: line 193: /usr/bin/sed: No such file or directory ERROR: option &#39;-e&#39; requires a non-empty argument  I did not understand what happened so I decided to google it! The bug was already identified and reported ðŸ˜„. A side note to mention that several packages now imports callr (for instance pkgdown) and as it uses the R command wrapper (if I understand correctly) the current bug actually affects several different packages.</description>

      <title>Thunderbird v60.3.0 solves them all!</title>

      <description>As I mentioned in a previous note, when I installed the version 60.0-3 of Thunderbird I was no longer able to write new emails and so I had to downgrade to v.52.9.1. Since that time, things have gotten worst as I was no longer able to get hyperlinks opening the corresponding page in my web browser ðŸ˜±. I did not look for a fix, I simply coped with it waiting for an update.</description>

      <title>Make your conditional statements efficient!</title>

      <description>Recently, I was looking at an R function and found a if statement that looks something like this:
if (length(which(names(df) == &amp;quot;entry&amp;quot;)) &amp;gt; 0) { # [...] }  I guess this is common way of doing it as it matches well with a way of looking at the problem: &amp;ldquo;if I want to test the presence of a column &amp;ldquo;entry&amp;rdquo; in a data frame (df), I can check if there is more at least one name that match &amp;ldquo;entry&amp;rdquo;.</description>
