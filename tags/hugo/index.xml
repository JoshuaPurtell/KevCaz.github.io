Recently, one of the authors mentioned that he was not able to clone the repository on his Windows machine. I came to realize that we better not assume that everybody is working on MacOS or Linux and check that inSileco works well on Windows. One of the most convenient way to do so is to use AppVeyor and I therefore decided to spend some time making the build passed on AppVeyor!</description></item><item><title>My video shortcode</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hugo/shortcodes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/hugo/shortcodes/</guid><description>Shortcodes are among my favorite features in Hugo. As I am currently writing several notes a week that often include small screencasts, I thought that the time had come for me to create my own screencast shortcode. Here it is:
&amp;lt;center&amp;gt; &amp;lt;video width=&#39; {{ if .Get &amp;quot;width&amp;quot; }} {{ .Get &amp;quot;width&amp;quot; }} {{ else }} 100% {{ end }}&#39; controls&amp;gt; &amp;lt;source src=&amp;quot;{{ .Get `src` }}&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;video/webm&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Your browser does not support the video tag.</description></item></channel></rss>
