      <description>Last week, I attended a &amp;ldquo;Midi confÃ©rence&amp;rdquo; (basically a one hour training session during lunch time) offered by Compute Canada dealing with Slurm, GNU Parallel and how to combine them. This was a very useful and timely presentation for me (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· slides available online ðŸ”—) as I&amp;rsquo;ve just got started with Slurm (see my previous notes on the topic) and was eager to learn more.
Earlier today, I found an opportunity to put in practice what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned last week.</description>
