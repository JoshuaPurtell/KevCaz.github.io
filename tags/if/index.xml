Since that time, things have gotten worst as I was no longer able to get hyperlinks opening the corresponding page in my web browser ðŸ˜±. I did not look for a fix, I simply coped with it waiting for an update.</description></item><item><title>Make your conditional statements efficient!</title><link>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/r/efficientif/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevcaz.github.io/notes/r/efficientif/</guid><description>Recently, I was looking at an R function and found a if statement that looks something like this:
1 2 3 if (length(which(names(df) == &amp;#34;entry&amp;#34;)) &amp;gt; 0) { # [...] } I guess this is common way of doing it as it matches well with a way of looking at the problem: &amp;ldquo;if I want to test the presence of a column &amp;ldquo;entry&amp;rdquo; in a data frame (df), I can check if there is more at least one name that match &amp;ldquo;entry&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
